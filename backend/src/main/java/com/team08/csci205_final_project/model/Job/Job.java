 * The {@code Job} class represents a job entity in the system.
 * It contains all the necessary information about a job, including details
 * about the service provider, transaction, and the user.
 * This class is annotated with Lombok annotations to generate boilerplate code
 * such as getters, setters, and constructors.
 * It is also mapped to the "jobs" collection in MongoDB using Spring Data's {@code @Document} annotation.
